# Month-End Tax Closing & Reporting Tracker (Excel + SAP)

A lightweight, GitHub-friendly demo project that tracks month-end tasks and uses a SAP invoice export tab to keep reporting inputs complete and timely.

## Files
- `Month_End_Tax_Closing_Reporting_Tracker.xlsx`
  - **Tasks**: timetable, owners, dependencies, follow-up flag
  - **SAP_Invoice_Export**: sample SAP export table (replace with your own)
  - **Dashboard**: KPI view + invoice status counts
  - **Config**: baseline vs current open items/follow-ups (for reduction KPIs)
  - **Instructions**: usage steps

## Example outcomes (sample data inside)
- On-time completion: ~**89%**
- Close-period open items reduction vs baseline: ~**23%**
- Follow-up/rework reduction vs baseline: ~**19%**

> Portfolio artifact: no live SAP connection required. Replace the sample export with a real SAP report when available.
